## A Realistic Evaluation of Semi-Supervised Learning for Fine-Grained Classification

### Dataset
In this CVPR-21 paper, we create a new semi-supervised benchmark on the [Semi-Aves](https://github.com/cvl-umass/semi-inat-2020) dataset. 
In addition, we provide the the split for Semi-Fungi, which is a subset of the [FGVCx-Fungi competition at FGVC5](https://github.com/visipedia/fgvcx_fungi_comp).
We also provide the split for CUB dataset, and a different split for Semi-Aves for cross-validation.

### Source Code
We will release the source code for reproducing the experiments in the CVPR 2021 paper soon.
